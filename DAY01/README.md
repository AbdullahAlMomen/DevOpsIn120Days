# DevOpsIn120Days | Day 1: DevOps Principles & Culture


## Today's Mission: Understand what is DevOps, why DevOps exists  and how its culture can transform how teams build software.

### Imagine you and your friends want to make a SUPER pizza.

1.  **Chefs (Developers):**  They create the recipe (code) and add toppings (features).
    
    -   _"Extra cheese! Spicy sauce! Pineapple? (Nooo!)"_
        
2.  **Oven Crew (Operations):**  They bake and deliver the pizza (run the app).
    
    -  "Oven’s too hot! Pizza burns! 
        

### **The Problem:**

-   Chefs yell:  "Why’s the oven broken?!"
    
-   Oven crew screams:  _“Your recipe sucks!”_
    
-   **Pizza arrives late, cold, or with bugs (literally! ).**
    

### **DevOps Saves the Day!**

-   **Teamwork:**  Chefs and oven crew  **work together**  (no blame!).
    
-   **Robot Helpers (Automation):**
    
    -   A  **robot**  mixes dough (CI/CD pipelines).
        
    -   A  **thermometer**  checks oven temp (Monitoring).
        
-   **Fast Feedback:**
    
    -   Taste-test  **every 5 mins**  (Testing), not after 5 hours!
        

### **Result?**

-   **Perfect pizza in 10 mins, not 10 hours!**
    
-   **No more fights-just high-fives!** 
    

**Moral:**  DevOps =  **“Cook together, deliver faster, and keep the pizza (and team) happy!”**

(Would they rather wait 3 hours for a burnt pizza or 20 mins for a perfect one? That’s DevOps!)  😄

**DevOps is a teamwork culture**  where:

-   **Developers, Testers, and IT Operations**  work together
    
-   **From coding → testing → deploying → monitoring**  (entire software lifecycle - SDLC)
    
-   **Automating everything possible**  (no manual slow work!)
    
-   **Using cool tools**  like GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
    

**Goal?**  **Deliver great software - FASTER and SMOOTHER!**  🚀

> Think of it like a pit crew in a race, everyone works together to keep the car running fast!

**The Big Picture**

**2009:**  A sysadmin at Flickr screams "*It takes 6 MONTHS to deploy code!*"  
**2010:**  Patrick Debois coins  "*DevOps*"  to break the  **"Wall of Confusion"**  between Dev & Ops.  
**Today:**  Companies deploying  **1000x/day**  (Amazon, Netflix) vs. those stuck in  _“But it works on my machine!”_

> This isn’t just history - it’s WHY you’re learning DevOps.

### **3 Core DevOps Principles:**

1.  **"You Build It, You Run It"**
    
    -   _No more throwing code over the wall!_
        
    -   Example: Netflix engineers  **on-call for their own services**.
        
2.  **“Fail Fast, Learn Faster”**
    
    -   _Small failures > Big explosions._
        
    -   Toyota’s  **Andon Cord**  principle: Anyone can stop production if they spot a bug.
        
3.  **“Automate Everything Painful”**
    
    -   _If it hurts, script it._
        
    -   How? → CI/CD pipelines replacing  _“Let me SSH and fix it”_  chaos.
        

----------

### **Culture:**

-   **"DevOps isn't Jenkins or Docker - this is team mindset"**
    
    -   Devs writing unit tests  **like they will see result**
        
    -   Ops sharing monitoring dashboards  **like Football match live score**
        

----------

### **Tasks for Today (Hands-On):**

1.  **Interview Someone:**
    
    -   Ask a senior:  _"What's the dumbest bottleneck in our workflow?"_
        
    -   Bonus: Find a  **“Blame Culture”**  example (e.g.,  _“QA didn’t test properly!”_).
        
2.  **read & Reflect:**
    
    -   [The Phoenix Project](https://www.runn.io/blog/the-phoenix-project-summary)  (5-min summary).
        
    -   Identify  **3 wastes**  in your current workflow (e.g., manual approvals).
        
3.  **Automate One Thing:**
    
    -   Even if it’s just a  **Bash script to clean old logs**  (`find /logs -type f -mtime +7 -delete`).
        

----------

### Interview Qs of the Day:

1.  How would you explain DevOps to a 10-year-old?
    
2.  What’s the difference between Agile and DevOps?
    
3.  Why is 'Mean Time to Repair' (MTTR) more important than 'Mean Time Between Failures' (MTBF) in DevOps?"
